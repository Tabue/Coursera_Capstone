Canadian people always like to do some physical activity to avoid obesity and most importantly, to cope with the cold environment. Canada is a generous country where people all of the world are settled in here and share their own sports and culture with the native Canadians. Thus Canada has become a country of variety of games and sports. The country have also showed their dominance in world sports as well as in Olympic games."
